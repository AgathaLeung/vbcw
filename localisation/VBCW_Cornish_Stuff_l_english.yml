KER_events.1.t:0 "The Cornish Propose a Trade Deal"
KER_events.1.d:0 "A few days ago, a Cornish delegation with a very thick accent arrived in the city of Cork. After a very confusing dialogue in which both sides attempted to understand each other, it was finally decided that these strange men must be here as some sort of delegation. They were taken to the local mayor who finally managed to get to the bottom of the situation - these men are a trade delegation for Kernow. They were invited to speak with our own ministers, and over a nice cup of tea decided that - "
KER_events.1.a:0 "The Cornish are nice chaps - yes, let us agree"
KER_events.1.b:0 "If we can Hardly understand them, how on Earth are we meant to trade?"
KER_events.2.t:0 "The Irish agree to the Deal"
KER_events.2.d:0 "Our delegation returned to Truro today. They told us of their voyage across the sea, their near-death encounter with a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-pounder cannon and how they finally reached Cork. After a large deal of inconvenience, they were finally given the time to talk to the Irish economic ministers. During a meeting that quickly devolved into small talk, it was decided that our two countries will, in fact, tighten trade relations. The immediate transportation of their coal and aluminium will commence and in return we will invest in some of their local industries."
KER_events.2.a:0 "How nice of them"
KER_events.3.t:0 "The Irish refused our Deal"
KER_events.3.d:0 "Our Delegation came back with a truly terrifying tale to tell! After a dangerous crossing to Cork, where their ship was boarded by a Royalist motorboat armed with a four-Pounder cannon, they had reached Cork. After a very rude conversation with the locals which included phrases such as 'these bloody Cornish' and 'God's sake speak English' the delegation was finally arranged to meet the Irish minister. After a very long and again, rude, conversation however, the negotiations broke down after one the Irish ministers said that 'We can't even understand you, how are we meant to trade?'. Our delegates may have been speaking unclearly yet that was no reason for the Irish to be so rude! We don't need their Stinking coal anyways...."
KER_events.3.a:0 "Bloody Irish, can't even give us some coal"
KER_events.4.t:0 "An Expedition to Norway"
KER_events.4.d:0 "The Norwegians have rare metals that could be of use to us for development and manufacture of advanced weapons. Though the seas are dangerous, we should attempt a daring expedition of our finest trade experts to the Norwegians. The expedition is ready to depart with a very large supply of tea and pasties for the way. "
KER_events.4.a:0 "Let us see how our Brave men fare."
KER_events.5.t:0 "Norwegians accept Deal"
KER_events.5.d:0 "Our experts returned earlier today, having completed their mission. Upon reaching Norway they were treated like honoured guests, even being granted an Audience with the King. The King was elated to hear of our intentions, and has agreed to begin the shipment of rare metals to our nation in exchange for our help with beurocratic matters. The first shipment of these metals has arrived with our envoys."
KER_events.5.a:0 "Jolly good"
KER_events.6.t:0 "The Norwegians refuse our Deal"
KER_events.6.d:0 "Having travelled many, many miles, our emissaries have returned from the snowy hills and icy seas of Norway. Facing many hardships on the way, we have faced off against enemy trawlers, avoided mines, faced harsh storms. Having reached the Norwegian Coast, we were not met by fanfares or even a nice welcome. Viewing us as renegades, we were welcomed as common brigands and ordered to turn our ship back around to where we came from. Seeing this as nothing more than a practical joke, we tried to start some sort of talk with the Norwegians. This ended poorly, as we were chased off by the local Gendarmes and were almost shot at by the coastal battery. They barely made it back alive."
KER_events.6.a:0 "They can keep their mangy fish for all we care"
KER_events.7.t:0 "Emissaries Sunk"
KER_events.7.d:0 "Early today, one of our trawlers returned from their patrol around the coast when they came upon a horrible sight. Our emissaries, aboard a clearly labelled diplomatic ship, were attacked by a Royalist submarine off the coast Portsmouth. The submarine gave our ship no warning, claiming that they believed the vessel to be a Q-Ship, an invention from the Great War. All aboard the ships were sunk, but our trawler was able to at least retrieve some of the tea we were to offer to the Norwegian King."
KER_events.7.a:0 "No wonder Chivalry is Dead"
KER_events.8.t:0 "The Focus of the Factories"
KER_events.8.d:0 "With the increasing number of munitions factories, our factories are becoming very unfocused, mainly putting together whatever they want. Because of this, it is becoming much more difficult to keep our armies well supplied. A council of our largest factory owners has been called in Truro - we should decide whether we should focus on quality rifles, or rather on assembling more artillery to feed our divisions on the front."
KER_events.8.a:0 "Focus on Artillery"
KER_events.8.b:0 "Focus on Quality Weapons"
KER_events.9.t:0 "A Tea Party at Truro"
KER_events.9.d:0 "With this whole civil war raging on, it seems we have all forgotten our manners! Whilst we are brave Cornish men, we are also civilised beings. Whilst Archbishop Cosmo Lang and King Eddie have had a bit of a fallout, there isn't something that a good old cuppa couldn't solve. Bishop Hunkin has sent out invitations to the pair, to meet at his Parish house in Truro for a good old fashioned cup of tea."
KER_events.9.a:0 "Bertha! Could you turn the kettle on dear?"
KER_events.10.t:0 "Pre-Party Preperations"
KER_events.10.d:0 "With the invitations sent out, a very large issue has become apparent - what should the Bishop wear?\n\n Whilst the Archbishop of Cantenbury would find it quite iffy to not wear vestments in the Parish house, the King might feel uncomfortable between two men of the cloth. Whilst one of the generals call for a good-old fashioned suit, the local parishoners are planning to call for a petition that Bishop Hunkin wears his Vestments to Tea."
KER_events.10.a:0 "Reginald, can you get the Vestments please!"
KER_events.10.b:0 "Jenny! Pass me the suit dear."
KER_events.11.t:0 "Pre-Party Preperations"
KER_events.11.d:0 "With the dress-code sorted, the forecast for the next few days is to be quite chilly. It has become apparent that the Archbishop will want to walk around Hunkin's famed gardens, and the need for a hat is very much the case. Again, this is a very important issue - shall the Bishop wear a Tophat or a Bowler hat?"
KER_events.11.a:0 "Time to brush the dust off the Tophat"
KER_events.11.b:0 "Blimey, I've not worn that Bowler Hat in forever"
KER_events.12.t:0 "Archbishop Cosmo Lang arrives"
KER_events.12.d:0 "Pulling up in his stylish Rolls-Royce with flags of the Anglican League proudly waving by its headlights. Stepping out the car in his vestments, he quickly came up to Bishop Hunkin, shaking his hand. What followed was very typical for Cosmo - a whole pantry arrived, with members of the Women's Institute and their followers taking the city by storm with their Sandwiches and tea. With the Archbishop now, all that is missing is King Edward himself to arrive."
KER_events.12.a:0 "Morning Archbishop! Quite chilly today, don't you think?"
KER_events.13.t:0 "King Edward VIII Arrives"
KER_events.13.d:0 "As lunchtime begun to loom, and the bishops began to get peckish, King Edward finally arrived. Driving into town on his beautiful 1937 Jaguar SS - luckily without Wallis by his side. Seeming to have a case of the cold, the king was holding a tissue the whole time, blowing his nose non-schalantly every now and again. After the formalities have been concluded, the trio of Hunkin, Cosmo and Edward finally entered the Parish House, impatient to eat lunch."
KER_events.13.a:0 "Just this way gentlemen."
KER_events.14.t:0 "Shall I be mother?"
KER_events.14.d:0 "As the trio made them selves comfortable - Cosmo Lang sitting down on the large sofa, King Edward taking his position on the Armchair and Hunkin on an antique chair, the hardest question of the evening has arisen - who shall be mother?"
KER_events.14.a:0 "The host should always pour"
KER_events.14.b:0 "Archbishop, you may have the honours"
KER_events.15.t:0 "How many sugars?"
KER_events.15.d:0 "With the formalities of the pouring completed, Bishop Hunkin was faced with another, terryfing dilemma. Whilst the Archbishop is known for his sweet tooth, the King has never made his preference public. With the two staring impatiently at the Bishop, holding the sugar bowl in his hand, a tough choice must be made."
KER_events.15.a:0 "One Sugar"

KER_events.16.d:0 "With the business of the Tea Drinking complete, there is still one thing left to do. The Bishop is known far and wide in Kernow for his wonderful and well-cultivated gardens. After a whole afternoon of 'oohs' , 'ahs' and 'that one looks like a dog pissed on it', the time for the two guests to leave. On the way out, the Bishop gave them :"

KER_events.17.a:0 "We must do this some other time"
KER_events.18.t:0 "The Tea War"
KER_events.18.d:0 "After visiting Bishop Hunkin and King Edward the VIII in Kernow, the Archbishop has returned from the tea party. Completely outraged by the way he was treated (He was made to pour tea AND recieved bad flowers), he has decided that there is only one way to solves this issue - a war over the Tea Party"

KER_events.23.t:0 "The Royal Gathering"
KER_events.23.d:0 "As a sovereign nation, Kernow must have a king to rule! Granted, we have been a democracy for so long, but it is sometimes nice to just spice things up, isn't it? The Mebyon Kernow, led by Quiller-Couch have decded that it is finally time to elect a king - and there are many dispossessed royals, waiting for a shot at the throne of a nation ; and what better than the Kingship of Kernow?\n\nLet us call all those European Chaps who want to have a shot at ruling our nation to come to Truro in two weeks time - and let us go on from there!"
KER_events.23.a:0 "How Terribly Exciting!"
KER_events.24.t:0 "Friederich von Hohenzhollern Arrives"
KER_events.24.d:0 "Across the sea and far off in the horizon, a small little black dot bobs up and down, up and down. After a few minutes, it comes closer, and over the loud cawing of the seagulls, a sputtering sound can be heard, slowly joined by the low rumble of a plane's engine. Finally, we see him in all its glory - a small, low flying Heinekel passenger plane, with the royal insigna of House Hohenzollern on it. As the plane lands at the airfield, a truly magnificent sight we behold.\n\nAs the doors of the aircraft opens, out come two butlers, dressed in fine black suits and waving two small Imperial German flags. Down the steps come perhaps the mightiest man we have ever seen - the son of the once-Kaiser. His chins flabbing as he descends onto our level, he comes up and shakes the hand of both Bishop Hunkin and Quiller-Couch ; "Guten Tag" comes the greeting out from beneath his neatly-trimmed moustache. "
KER_events.24.a:0 "Guten Tag indeed!"
KER_events.25.t:0 "Friederich von Wettin Arrives"
KER_events.25.d:0 "We watch in excitement as from far off, the loud sound of a sea horn can be sound. As the ship comes closer and closer, even the sound of a loud marching band can be heard from the deck of the ship. The strong wind unfurls the royal standard of the von Wettin House, as loud cheers can be heard from across the Bay. As the HMS Wettin docks in the port, the Prince Friederich is greeted by a Royal Cornish Assembly - with Pasty and Wine!\n\nThe Princes chortles after hearing a witty remark from Quiller Couch, as he bites into a freshly baked pastie, smiles to himself and proceeds onto the feast in the Truro Hall."
KER_events.25.a:0 "Here's to hoping we have enough food!"
KER_events.26.t:0 "The Royal Feast"
KER_events.26.d:0 "It is now time to begin the greatest part of the election! As the many possible Kings of Kernow gather around the table - including Carmain the Janitor from Penzance, Lord Stammertounge from the Court at Bodmin and some chap I bumped into in the mess called Bernard - they are all seated around in front of the Bishop of Truro, Joseph Hunkin and the leader of the Mebyon Kernow, Arthur Quiller-Couch.\n\nAs the feast begins, the drink starts to flow, the tounges come loose and many a chicken and pasty is passed around, the contenders for the throne begin to boast. As the music starts to get ever louder and louder, the contenders for the throne begin to make their way before the Cornish Assembly."
KER_events.26.a:0 "Let them Speak!"
KER_events.27.t:0 "The Boasting Competiton"
KER_events.27.d:0 "As the speaker for House Hohenzollern steps forwards, he stretches out his hand and beckons to his liege:\n\n "Herein stand, before you all, the true contender for the throne! He is a descendent of House Hohenzollern, the son of the great Kaiser Wilhelm II. It was he, who defended against the French Armies when they inched ever closer to Berlin during the war of '14! He held off a whole squadron of French Curassiers single-handedly with this here sabre" - he shows to the whole assembly a curved, one handed sabre clearly more than a couple centuries old, rusted and bent - "It was he wh-"\n\nHe is interrupted as loud laughter begins to envelop the room, the whole congregation imagining this man holding off anything but his own appetite. As the Hohenzollern's cheeks start to turn red, forwards comes the Von Wettin representative, the Prince trudging slowly behind him.\n\n"My Dear lords and ladies! Don't listen to all that tosh that this man is spouting! In front of you stands the only man who could be considered King of Kernow! This man defended the coast of Germany from the Communists Sailors of 1919, where he destroyed a whole brigade merely with two shots of a cannon. In the wilds of Russia, he fought and defeated a whole gathering of Bears, choking them with one hand whilst holding off a whole force of Russians with his other hand! He is the only man you could ever consid-"\n\n "Now now gentlemen, to boast is not the same as to lie! I, Bernard of Padstow is the only one you can ever consider your king! It was I who fought off a whole Royalist regiment attacking across the Tamar! I was the one who fought off a trawler fleet of the Labour Union when they came across the Bay of Lundy. I name these Germans pretenders, and declare myself the only rightfu-"\n\nA loud screech is heard as Eitel Friedrich jumps onto Bernard of Padstow. Within seconds, the whole hall erupts into a mad rage as tables are flung, guests jump on each other and food is thrown across the hall. The three main contenders for the throne jump across the tables as they continue fighting each other, one meaty punch after the other. After minutes of brawling, Bernard of Padstow if thrown out of the room by a powerful fling from the von Wettin. As the rest of the guests begin to stand, completely and utterly out of breath, they witness the two German Princes battle it out, knives, forks, pasties and wine goblet being thrown alike. As the shouts become louder and louder, the fight ends, and one Friderich comes forwards to shake the Bishop's hand - the clear sign of a winner..."

KER_events.28.t:0 "The Distribution of the Bread"
KER_events.28.d:0 "It's a chilly day in the city of Truro as the bells begin to ring out. As the King makes his way down to the Truro Cathedral for the beginning of the bread distribution, he sees a few trucks with armed militia make their way to the cathedral - surely just extra protection for himself. As the Mercedes Benz makes it way into the Cathedral carpark, the king is greeted by Bishop Hunkin in his finest vestments, as well as by a few other prominent members of the Clergy. Heaving his weight out of the car, the King makes his way into the Cathedral to take part in the Service - which will be followed by the distribution of bread to the local population as a gift from the King for St Pirian's Day."

KER_events.29.d:0 "As the cathedral doors close and the loud singing of the hymns begin, the captian of the the Militia beckons to his fellow soldiers. A low rumbling is heard as down Old Bridge St comes a convoy of three Matildas, two Daimlers and a Valentine makes its way down the streets. The milita begins to occupy the buildings next to the Cathedral whilst a crowd control unit of the Little Kernow Legion begins to disperse the crowd backs to their homes. The royal coat of arms of the King's House is torn down from the street lights as they are replaced with the Bishop's own Coat of Arms.

As the two altar boys open the main door, the King is suddenly met with the sight of thirty-odd militiamen pointing their guns at him, with a Bren Gun emplacement behind them. As he turns around, he is also greeted by three altar boys, each now wearing a helmet and holding Webleys in their hands. As the king begins to panic and look around for any sort of assistance, his eyes meet with those of the Bishop. Smiling, the Bishop slowly makes his way down the aisle, clapping as he walks. As he beckons to his milita, four soldiers come up to the king, punching him in the stomach as he doubles over and falls. He is dragged out of the Cathedral and put into the back of an Armoured Rolls-Royce which is then driven down High Cross Road, on the way out of town."

With martial law declared for the next few days, the streets are empty as a single Matilda makes its way down Station Road. As the three soldiers accompanying it make turn left into George Street, a loud shot rings out through the gloom of the afternoon. As one of the soldiers falls down, twenty gardeners armed with muskets, revolvers and their tools run out of the shops and start heaving at the tank. Within minutes, the two other soldiers are disarmed as the gardeners make their way inside the Matilda. As the tank crew is pulled out, the gardeners begin to cheer.\n\nAs another loud gunshot is heard, all the Gardeners take off their hats as from the shadow of an alleyway emerges a man, dressed in the finest gardeners suit, wearing a sturdy hat on his head. All the gardeners bow down, as the man climbs to the top of the tank and stands.As people begin to emerge from the buildings, many are stunned to see who this strange man is - none other, but Bernard of Padstow ; And he is out for vengance!"

The plane lands on the airfield, and the Bishop is met by Franco himself. Hands are shook, kisses exchanged and the move towards the lunchroom begins. As the Cornish and Spanish delegates walk together to the lunch hall, the Jefe and Bishop begin to talk about the current state of Britain and Spain and the possibility of a mutual help agreement. As Franco laughs following a joke from the Bishop, the couple enters into the grand hall. As they sit down, Franco pours some beer for the Bishop, now laughing heartily about a Joke relating to Frenchmen and Frogs. Suddenly, there is a strong scent in the air. In come three butlers, wheeling in a whole plateful of Fish, Chips and Veg. The Bishop looks slightly surprised, but he tucks into the fish, complementing the work of Manuel, the Chef, and the fine fish.\n\nFranco smiles and himself tucks into the fish, within minutes devouring two...three...four.

The Bishop is welcomed into Il Duce's car, as the Fiat speeds off towards the city of Rome. With the wind in the Bishop's hair, of which there isn't much - though considerably more than on the Duce's head - the car makes its way around a few sharp corners. A joke from the Bishop about how "All Roads Lead to Rome" is met with a heavy laugh from the Dictator who slaps his knees and stamps his feet.\n\nAs the Fiat parks outside the Duce's residence, the two leaders make their way up to the Lunch table where they begin to talk business. The Duce, ever fond of the Cornish and their 'similarity to the Romans', for whatever that means, is quick to suggest that the Cornish could definetely benefit from the help from Italians, in exchange for some of their culinary secrets. The Bishop ponders as he begins to scoff down his Spaghetti, a bit of tomato sauce making it's way onto his black shirt. As the meal continues - a Risotto dish, some Ciabatta, Minestrone, a dish of Pesce, and for dessert some Pancetta - the couple chat away, sometimes in English, sometimes in Italian. Eventually, with the Duce now very merry, two bottles of Vino Blanco are shared between the two as tounges become ever looser.\n\nAfter a rest, the Duce suggests that the Bishops comes for a Jog with him, before an agreement is reached. The Bishop, ever patient, decides to join in and jogs alongside the Duce who wears his finest running clothes.\n\nThe next Morning, the Bishop positively stuffed and tired, falls back on his chair on the plane - the support of the Italians secured."

As the plane sputters and lands, the Bishop quickly gets out before the whole thing sets on fire - with the engine having well overheated during the flight. As the siren begins to wail, a small platoon of Feuerschutzpolizei drives in on a transformed Opel Blitz, quickly putting the fire down. No casualties, bar the Bishop's basket of pasties, are sustained.\n\nClearly in shock, the Bishop is invited to a small guardhouse on the airfield, where he is give some Bratwurst and Bier to bring him back to reality. A few minutes later, ready to move on with the day, the Bishop explains in broken German that he is ready to meet with the Fuhrer. As he is escorted to a fine BMW, he is driven up to the Reichstag where he is greeted by the Fuhrer in front of a whole unit of his Leibstandarte. As he is greeted by Herr Hitler, the Bishop quickly apologies for his boorish behaviour and the absence of pasties. He is quickly cut off by the Fuhrer who looks rather dissapointed, but nonetheless taken up the Fuhrer's own dining room where he is treated with a fine Strudel, some Apple Juice and even some tea - black of course, with no milk ; very German. The two chat away, talking about the state of the world, laughing about the French and discussing the future plans for expanding Cornish living space - a topic which cleary unsettles the Bishop, but nonetheless keeps the conversation going. As the Fuhrer lightens up, the couple begin to joke around, eventually leading to a pint of beer....two pints....three pints. By late evening, the Fuhrer, Bishop Hunkin, Joseph Goebbels and Goering are all in one room, playing charades.\n\nTwo days later, the Bishop is back in Truro, having flown back in a brand new Dornier airplane - and with a small shipment of weapons and tanks on their way to Penzance."

KER_events.36.d:0 "It is a cold, bleak morning as the two agents of the C.S.S - codenames 'Penzance' and 'Padstow' - emerge from their car in front of Spode's apartment. As they walk towards the door, they are quickly stopped by two Blackshorts who demand that they turn around, lest they have an appointment. The two agents, dressed as cooks, hand the two soldiers two pasties, apologise, and make their way back to the car. After five seconds of walking, they turn around as the two Blackshorts fall to the floor, incapacitated by the chemicals in the Pasty. As they stuff the Blackshorts into the back of their car, the two agents enter into the building. Sneaking around, they make their way to Spode's study which seems to be empty. As they scour thorugh the documents, they find many various useless documents - three orders for pairs of Blackshorts, a letter to the farmers of Stratford-upon-tyne and many sketches of knees - the agents almost give up until they find the document they were looking for all along ; the documents containing the sacred word, 'Eulalie'.\n\nThe two agents quickly scarper out of the building, jump back into the car and make their way back to their London hideout. It is late in the evening when Spode makes his way to a dark alleway in downtown London, alone as the note stated. As the Cornishman lights his cigar, Spode begins to demand as to why these men have called him to come here. He stops mid sentence as Agent Penzance mutters - 'Eulalie'. Even in the dark, it can be seen as Spode's face goes pale, and his strong British knees begin to tremble. Within a few minutes, the threat is delievered and Spode agrees - in exchange for a steady supply of root vegetables to Kernow, the secrets of his Lingerie designer days will not be revealed to the public. Having signed the agreement, Spode begins to slowly jog away from the alleway as the two agents begin to laugh..."
KER_events.37.t:0 "Operation Hwiogennow"
KER_events.37.d:0 "Agent Penzance and Agent Padstow slowly make their way out of their car as the constables continue their beat down the Westminster Bridge. Nodding to the agents, who are dressed in plain workmen clothing, the constables make their way further down the road. As the two agents make their way towards the door of the Clock Tower, they show the guards their permits - forged to the highest of standards - as they are let through, carrying their large canvas bags. Making their way up the maze of corridors, floors and stairwells, they finally make their way up to the back of the clockface itself. Now close to midday, the crowds below hear the familiar ringing of the bell for 12PM when suddenly, there is an ammased 'ooh' as hundreds of people look up to the top of the tower. Right in front of the clockface, possibly up to 30 feet long, now hangs the flag of St Pirian! "
